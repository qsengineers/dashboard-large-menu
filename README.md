# Qikserve's Dashboard Menu challenge

This challenge consists of building a react application to allow managers managing a menu in a restaurant.
Of course, we are gonna build limited features as a whole dashboard would take too much time :D

Restaurant Data should be consumed from the provided json below. Do not mock the json's, fetch the data from url below.

## UI - Application

I expect your application to be able to:
- Render all items from URL above (I'm not expliciting how)
- - Please don't use paginations. I don't to click on page to see its contents.
- An item should be showing:
- - Item name
- - Item image (if available)
- When hovering an item, i would like to see an "edit" button
- Clicking on "edit" button, i would like to see the item's details on right side.
- I don't expect to see lags in the application.

An example of how it is in our platform currently:
